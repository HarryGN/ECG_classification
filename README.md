Autoencoder for ECG Classification :heartbeat: :brain:
This repository contains code for an autoencoder implemented in Python using TensorFlow for ECG (Electrocardiogram) classification.

What is an Autoencoder? :thinking:
An autoencoder is a type of neural network that can be used for unsupervised learning tasks, such as dimensionality reduction or data compression. It consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes an input signal and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation, called the latent space. The decoder then takes this compressed representation and attempts to reconstruct the original input signal.

Autoencoder Structure :building_construction:
The autoencoder implemented in this code consists of the following parts:

Encoder: several convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer that outputs the compressed representation.

Decoder: several deconvolutional layers followed by a final fully connected layer that produces the reconstructed signal.

Advantages of Using an Autoencoder for ECG Classification :muscle:
The advantages of using an autoencoder for ECG classification are as follows:

Unsupervised Learning: An autoencoder can learn to extract useful features from the ECG signal without requiring labeled data.

Data Compression and Denoising: Autoencoders can be used for data compression and denoising, which can improve the performance of downstream tasks such as ECG classification. By compressing the ECG signal into a lower-dimensional representation, the autoencoder can reduce the amount of noise in the signal and remove redundant information, making it easier for a classifier to distinguish between different types of ECG signals.

Conclusion :memo:
The implementation of an autoencoder for ECG classification is a promising technique that can be used to extract useful features from ECG signals. By compressing the ECG signal into a lower-dimensional representation, the autoencoder can reduce the amount of noise in the signal and remove redundant information, making it easier for a classifier to distinguish between different types of ECG signals. This technique can be particularly useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.
